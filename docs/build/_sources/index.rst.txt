HyperNetX (HNX)

Description
===========

The HNX library provides classes and methods for modeling the entities and relationships 
found in complex network data as hypergraphs. Hypergraphs are natural models for multi-dimensional
data structures. They distinguish cliques and simplices. They recognize both vertex adjacency and edge
incidence as having a *width* because of the multiway connections. And, they permit singleton
vertices and edges. Most graph metrics have natural generalizations to hypergraphs, but since
hypergraphs are basically set systems, we can also use the powerful tools of algebraic topology
to study their structure.

This library serves as a repository of the methods and algorithms we find most useful
as we explore what hypergraphs can tell us. We have a growing community of users and contributors.

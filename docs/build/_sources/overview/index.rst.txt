The `HyperNetX`_ library provides classes and methods for the analysis
and visualization of complex network data. HyperNetX uses data structures
designed to represent set systems containing nested data and/or multi-way
relationships. The library generalizes traditional graph metrics to hypergraphs.

`HypernetX`_ was developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the
Hypernets project as part of its High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) program.
PNNL is operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under Contract DE-ACO5-76RL01830.

* Principle Developer and Designer: Brenda Praggastis

* Principle Investigator: Emilie Purvine
* Program Manager: Cliff Joslyn, Mark Raugas
* Mathematics, methods, and algorithms: Sinan Aksoy, Dustin Arendt, Cliff Joslyn, Brenda Praggastis, and Emilie Purvine
* Software support: Kyle Monson

The current version is preliminary. We are actively testing and would be grateful
for comments and suggestions.  Expect changes in both class names and methods as
many of the requirements demanded of the library are worked out.

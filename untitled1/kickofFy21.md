##Notes 
Expect Orientation with Thrust Leads: Sutanay
Threads go across thrusts - 
Math and ML thread - how does math and ml interact (Tony)
Human Factors thread - how will users interact with project (Brett)
**Project Coordinators:**
Tara Lacic
Christina 
Myra
Jamie Berglund - Admin
Karen Smith - Communication Strategies
Brian Kritzstein - communicates with review committee, Executive secretary

**What is the Objectie of MARS?**
For AI to be standard, r&d needs to be done to operationalize AI - system designed to function autonomously accurately and eficiently in diverse environments, remaining fault-tolerant
Sense ->learn->reason->adapt

Most critical areas: Explainable, Autonomous, Domain Aware
The foundation of AI is based on 
learners - DNN
reasoners - Bayes nets
planners
MARS - how do we make these more explainable, and domain aware?
At a systems level we have a learner, reasoner, and adapter(planner) - self driving car 
    how does this system become more trusted and domain aware?
Role of pure math in ML - has begun to make a powerful impact, fundamental math techniques making in roads
human factors in AI - the ability to measure the performance of a human and an ai system working together to perform a task.

Tony Chaing - special interest group - pure math and ML - Friday - moving to Tuesdays (Carlos, Henry leading a working
group as LDRD PIs - seminar series background to machine learning)
Where does theory fit in for machine learning - limited theoretical foundation (math) models are becoming so complex
most of these models are trained once, because they are so large, and no one knows why they work. Need some math
theory to justify decisions. Obtain guarantees - find global minimum - what is the underlying landscape
integrate theory and tools from random matrix theory and classical statistics, lost landscape
understand randomness that is inherent in these models
want to leverage MARS community to establish us a a leader in understanding the theory of these models

Brett Jefferson - human factors, expainable AI - to who, what is the sophistication, what internal model must the 
user have. We need a model of how the human is working with the AI. Quantitative measures of how well these tasks
are done. Brett, will craft how trust in AI is defined by a human

## MARS Workshops
Neural Symbolic Learning (Sutanay Choudhury) - graph theoretic work on DNN 
    **how can you speed up performance (talk to Sutanay about Andrew's work)**
Reinforcement Learning (Sam Chatterjee)
Domain Informed (Aaron Tuor)

## Budget - buckets of money
P&A - internal overreaching initiative
PDM External sponsor outreach/proposal writing
LDRD Research dollars - all research must be done under this WPN

Spend Plans:
every month do a close out, update spend plan and compare to baseline variance
naming needs to be consistent

new hires - if you are considering any new hires, include admins from the beginning, as well as Sutanay to make sure
they are accounted for. New hires need to know where their funding will come from.
must include PC and Thrust Lead
metrics need to be tracked.
DGRP intern - 2 year commitment

Service Centers -
include any potential purchase orders, cloud computing resources,
university subcontracting, these pieces need to go through PCs
cannot purchase equipment on LDRDs. 
for each LDRD, we get free resources on Research Computing, there is a cap for LDRD
contact Myra to determine these costs.

Questions?
==========
**1. When do you start trying to get sponsor support outside of MARS?**
There are funds for this - see Luke
Kevin Kronk could define sponsor 
**2. How do you fund talking with sponsor?**
PDM is for creating sponsor presentation -  putting a bowtie on it.
Any tweeks for sponsor, involving research - must be on LDRD.
